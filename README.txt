This project serves to lessen the manual labour needed when designing a Danish crossword.


IDEAS
=====
When the crossword is nearly done, e.g. the four corner words and several other full length words are done, it is relatively well constrained.
Perhaps this is the crucial first step at which to implement an automatic solver.
Development could begin at the end of a finished crossword.
Here the problem is very well constrained which eases the development.
Steps back can then be taken along with the process becomming more complex and automatic.
